The landscape of writing web applications has come a long way over the years. At 23 years old, Javascript is in it's prime, the language of the web. Years ago Javascript was once synonymous with JQuery, back when the focus was on using it as a platform for DOM manipulation and events. Not long after came patterns for building the entire front-end, data binding frameworks like [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) started to gain traction, Twitter came along with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and suddenly everyone's personal projects started looking a lot more slick. 

Eventually MVC frameworks came around unifying the whole approach, you had Javascript models and controllers feeding into data-binded HTML and with the likes of [Angular](https://angularjs.org/) or [Ember](https://emberjs.com/) it all became pretty straight-forward. I remember evaluating both of these frameworks for a project in Kainos about 5 years ago, Angular is still heavily in use on that project and going strong.

For me, the next evolution in the way I write and think about Javascript has come in the form of [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/). With the ability to write server-side code in Javascript I can have my routing, state-management, validation, client-side controls and even my database interactions all written in one single language. Node describe themselves as an _asynchronous event driven JavaScript runtime, designed to build scalable network applications_. With it's single threaded event loop and HTTP focused design, it's great for building scalable micro-service API and front-end applications. 

Node itself has many frameworks out there designed to save you stress and time getting up and running. Although each framework may vary slightly in it's foundational aspirations, patterns and guidelines, it's all Node. Some of the stars of the show are:

1. [Adonis](https://adonisjs.com/)
2. [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
3. [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/)
4. [Nest](https://nestjs.com/)

I've personally been working with Express for about 14 months on a large microservice architecture processing around 3 million transactions every year. We've used it to drive APIs, front-ends, message brockers, you name it. It's minimalistic, non-opinionated and as a result easy to shape towards your particular needs. It reminds me a lot of Python's [Flask](https://www.fullstackpython.com/flask.html).

If you're thinking about using Node.JS in an upcoming project hopefully these next few sections are for you, we'll talk about tools and patterns to enchance the quality of your solution and increase productivity. 

## NPM

Node Package Manager comes with Node.JS out of the box so you won't get very far before you bump into it. As world's largest open source software registry, NPM is used to fetch any javascript libraries that your application needs for development and production. More often that not if you're thinking of writing some sort of component, there's a node module for that. Not only is it simple to use, it's fast even in mature projects.

## Typescript

If you're working with Node or any serious Javascript that you plan to release into a production environment, Typescript is a no brainer. Applying a bit of static typing to your project, especially a team project, goes a long way. Using interfaces in your code not only improves readability and maintainability, it allows you to utilize tools that will catch problems in your code automatically and this in turn allows you to build and refactor quicker. Furthermore, static typing allows you to utilize dependancy injection/IoC libraries like [InversifyJS](https://github.com/inversify/InversifyJS), taking you one step forward towards predictable, testable, easily maintainable code. At the end of the day, it all compiles down to Javascript anyway so you've got the dynamic aspects of the language when you need it. 

## Swagger

Building an API? Need documentation? [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/) in particular is a great option as it provides a visual interface that allows you to interact with your API endpoints. This is all fueled by a `swagger.json` file which can be generated automatically as you make changes to your code, so it's kept up to date with no effort. This is great for testing API endpoints manually and serves as an interactive specification of your API that can be sent to customers. As you might have guessed, there's a [package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-ui) on NPM for it too.

## Inversify

As I touched on in the Typescript section, Inversify is an Inversion of Control container that works well with Typescript. If you're not sure what Inversion of Control containers are, essentially the idea here is if you write your code in such a way where individual components depend on abstractions/interfaces as opposed to concrete implementations, this is what's called [dependancy inversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle). An IoC container allows you to take that one step further where you're not even responsible for instantiating any implementations of these interfaces yourself. You just tell the IoC container how you want things wired up, i.e. which implementations should be injected for which abstractions, then the container can do the heavy lifting. 

The benefit you get is that all your implementation instantiations can be defined in a single file, but as a side effect of your code adhering to SOLID principles it's extremely easy to change and test different implementations.
