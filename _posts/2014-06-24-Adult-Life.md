![Yep]({{ site.url }}/assets/responsibility.gif)

I've reached the end of 18 years of education, finishing it with a first class honours degree in Computing and the highest mark in the year, so I've got that going for me, which is nice.

As such I also start full-time employment at Kainos next week and will most definitely be trying to upskill for whatever project I end up on. A new house to live in, a new car to drive with, the list goes on. Well it doesn't go on much further than that, but still. I'm a unique snowflake and nobody else faces these struggles. 

## Placement vs Graduate employment

Going into graduate employment the plan now is to get on the ball as a professional. It's all about getting the work-life balance right, during placement I took part in a bunch of activities outside of work to progress myself as a developer however looking back I didn't do nearly enough.

For the most part, placement life was: work, go home, play video games. There was no extra learning, I did enough to be ok on my project, nothing special, just alright. I think the mentality that year was after the 9-5 the last thing I wanted to do when I got home was more work. That attitude combined with my inability to really deal with the then-recent break up of my long time girlfriend resulted in a pretty depressing year. 

But.. That's all behind me now, once again I'm actually motivated. I'm not saying I'm going to literally spend 16 hours a day being productive, time you enjoy wasting isn't wasted after all. But I will definitely try to organise my time and once again dedicate time outside of work to things I enjoy doing like programming and learning new languages.

I'm fortunate enough to work with people who are much smarter than me and although some of them have left Kainos to move on to bigger things, hopefully I will still see them around, there's much to learn!
