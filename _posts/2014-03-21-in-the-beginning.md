Back in 2009 or so I used to have a blog under the domain kyle-davidson.com to document my time in a programming competition. I stopped blogging for a few years because I lost interest, wanted to focus on other things etc. 

## Why are you documenting your thoughts again? I ask myself...
Well I want some sort of website to keep track of everything I'm doing. It's essentially an online timeline of me as I move through my career at Kainos and possibly beyond. 

## Who's Kyle Davidson?
As of writing this I'm a 22 year old Software Developer wrapping up my degree at University of Ulster Coleraine. I work as a breaker of builds for [Kainos](http://kainos.com) and I'm not really into coming up with some flamboyant role or title for myself, I've met too many "Founders" of nothing notable than I'd care to admit. I'm just a regular guy, trying to be better.
