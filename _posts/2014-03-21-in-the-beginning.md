Back in 2009 or so I used to have a blog under the same domain to document my time in a programming competition when i was just starting out. Since then I've got older obviously but also more experienced in the world of technology, if only a little.

# Why are you documenting your thoughts again? I ask myself
Well I want some sort of website to keep track of everything I'm doing, I want to blog and learn to do other stuff good too. It's essentially a online timeline of me as my move through my career at Kainos and possibly beyond.

## Who's Kyle Davidson?
Who indeed. As of writing this I'm a 22 year old Software Developer wrapping up my degree at University of Ulster Coleraine. I work as a breaker of builds for [Kainos](http://kainos.com) and I'm not really into coming up with my some flamboyant role or title for myself, I've met too many "Founders" of nothing notable than I'd care to admit. I'm just a regular guy.

The things I care about are:
- Family and Friends
- Becoming a better developer, learning new technologies
- Fitness
- Beer

So if you're reading this I'll be using this site to document myself really, keep track of projects, things i do, bloggy type stuff really.
