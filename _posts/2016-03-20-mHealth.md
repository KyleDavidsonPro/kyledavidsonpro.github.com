This weekend I attended the [mHealth](http://mhealth.be/en/home/) hackathon in Belgium with a team of developers: [Marek](https://twitter.com/marekkaluzny), [Matthew](https://twitter.com/matthewfitch23), [Peter](https://twitter.com/PMc_A) and [Stephen](https://twitter.com/iSteveyBrown). As a group we have a lot of experience with Hackathons, personally I've been to health focused hackathons before in Dublin, Liverpool and Barcelona. Generally the format across these type of events is the same, a mix of healthcare and technology professionals get together to pitch ideas, form teams and build a prototype solution. However, there was something very unique about this event.

##Day 1

In the morning the team captains pitched their ideas and descriptions of these ideas were hung up around the room. Each participant was given 3 post-it notes to stick on their favourite ideas they would like to help build.
